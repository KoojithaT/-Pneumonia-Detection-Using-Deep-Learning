# -Pneumonia-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This project applies Convolutional Neural Networks and transfer learning (VGG16, ResNet50, and a custom PneumoniaNet) to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Achieves over 95% accuracy with strong generalization on real-world data. Built using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenCV.
